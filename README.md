# Abstract 

Unavailability and inefficiency in COVID-19 diagnostic testing prevents millions from
getting tested and increases risk to the healthy population. To help solve these issues, we propose
a deep learning model to identify COVID-19 chest X-rays. We use transfer learning and tune a
pre-trained model, ResNet50, to maximize overall accuracy. The resulting model has an overall
accuracy of 92.4% on unseen data. This shows the potential for transfer learning and deep neural
networks to distinguish amongst normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 chest X-rays. In the current
COVID-19 pandemic, this could help ease the pressure off traditional PCR diagnostic tests,
while future implementation could use deep learning for diagnostic radiology.
